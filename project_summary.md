# Money-Mitra Project Analysis

## Project Overview

Money-Mitra is a comprehensive financial analysis platform with the following features:
- Stock analysis and price tracking
- Technical and fundamental analysis
- Indian and US market support
- News and sentiment analysis
- Watchlist management
- Financial statement analysis

## Technical Assessment

### Dependencies
The application relies on several Python packages:
- streamlit - For web interface
- yfinance - For stock data retrieval
- plotly - For interactive charts
- pandas - For data manipulation
- nsetools - For Indian market data
- openai - For AI-powered analysis
- trafilatura - For web scraping
- and several other supporting libraries

### Environment Issues
During our testing, we encountered persistent segmentation faults when running Python scripts. These issues occurred with:
1. The main Streamlit app
2. Simplified test versions of the app
3. Minimal test scripts using just yfinance
4. Even basic pandas operations

This suggests a fundamental issue with the Python environment rather than with the code itself.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Python Environment**:
   - Reinstall Python (consider using a package manager like Homebrew)
   - Or create a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`
   - Or try using conda to create an isolated environment

2. **API Keys Required**:
   - OPENAI_API_KEY - For AI-powered analysis and news summarization
   - You mentioned having an EODHD API key which could be used as an alternative to yfinance

3. **Working with the App**:
   - Once the environment issues are resolved, you can run the app using: `streamlit run app.py`
   - The app should be accessible at http://localhost:8501 in your browser

4. **Alternative Data Sources**:
   - If yfinance continues to cause issues, consider implementing EODHD API as the primary data source
   - Other alternatives include Alpha Vantage, Financial Modeling Prep, or Polygon.io

## Next Steps

1. Fix the Python environment issues
2. Run a basic test to ensure pandas and other core packages work
3. Configure required API keys as environment variables
4. Run the full application

The core functionality of Money-Mitra appears to be well-designed, with comprehensive features for financial analysis. Once the environment issues are resolved, it should provide valuable insights for stock analysis and investment decisions.
